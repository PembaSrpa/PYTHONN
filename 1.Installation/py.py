# what exactly is python?
Python is a high-level, interpreted, interactive and object-oriented scripting language. Python is designed to be highly readable.

# Why learn python?
Python is a versatile language that can be used for a wide range of applications, from web development to data science.

# Python's root and it's ecosystem
Python's root is Guido van Rossum. Python's ecosystem is a collection of tools and libraries that can be used to build applications.

# Python's features
1. Easy to learn
2. Easy to read
3. Easy to write
4. Easy to debug
5. Easy to test
6. Easy to deploy
7. Easy to maintain

# Python's installation and IDEs setting up
1. Download the latest version of Python from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/
2. Run the installer and follow the instructions.
3. Add Python to the PATH environment variable.
4. Open a command prompt and type "python --version" to verify that Python is installed correctly.
5. Install an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) like PyCharm, VSCode, etc.
6. Open the IDE and create a new project.
7. Create a new file and write your code in it.
8. Run the code and see the output.

# Python's Frameworks and Python Syntax
1. Python's Frameworks are a collection of tools and libraries that can be used to build applications. Some popular frameworks are:
    - Django (web development)
    - Flask (web development)
    - FastAPI (APIs)
    - TensorFlow and PyTorch (machine learning)
    - Pandas and NumPy (data analysis)
    - Pygame (game development)
    - Tkinter (desktop applications)

2. Python Syntax refers to the rules of how Python code is written. Some basic examples are:
    - Variables:
        x = 10
        name = "Artt"
    - Conditions:
        if x > 5:
            print("Greater")
    - Loops:
        for i in range(5):
            print(i)
    - Functions:
        def add(a, b):
            return a + b
    - Classes:
        class Dog:
            def __init__(self, name):
                self.name = name
    - Input/Output:
        user = input("Enter name: ")
        print(user)
    - Comments:
        # This is a comment

# Hands on writing code on Google Colab
1. Open the Google Colab website: https://colab.research.google.com/
2. Create a new notebook.
3. Write your code in the notebook.
4. Run the code and see the output.
5. Save the notebook and share it with others.
